# About

We are a group of artists , technologists and designers from Bangalore city focused on livecoding, computer music, hardware, audiovisual performance and all things generative. This website is an attempt to consolidate our Meetups/ Jams and to create a **Directory of Creative coders & Livecoders from India** to help anyone looking for like-minded people to collaborate, build, host events, [algoraves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave) and more <3.

Livecode.blr is a local node of [Algorave India](https://algorave.in/).



# What is Livecoding?

Livecoding is the practice of using computers and programming for artistic expression. While traditional music and visual production processes are effectively opaque, a key component to LiveCoding is transparency, displaying the code and interfaces that produce the sights and sounds in real time. Some guiding principles of our community include: Exposing algorithmic processes, challenging established institutions and hierarchies, collaborative efforts with other communities, equitable practices of diversity and inclusion, and making space for experimentation and failure.

Although we are a livecoding group, we are open to people from all sorts of backgrounds with an interest in computer music, creative tech, the new media arts and generative design. Feel free to attend a meeting and find out if it's for you!
